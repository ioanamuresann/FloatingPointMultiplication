2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Number1_comp/cifra1/tmp_reg[0] {FDCE}
    Number1_comp/cifra1/tmp_reg[1] {FDCE}
    Number1_comp/cifra1/tmp_reg[2] {FDCE}
    Number1_comp/cifra1/tmp_reg[3] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Number1_comp/cifra2/tmp_reg[0] {FDCE}
    Number1_comp/cifra2/tmp_reg[1] {FDCE}
