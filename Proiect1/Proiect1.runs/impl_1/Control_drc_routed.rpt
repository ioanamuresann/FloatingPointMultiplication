PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number1_comp/nextD/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2/O, cell Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number1_comp/nextD/tmp_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__0/O, cell Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number1_comp/nextD/tmp_reg[0]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__1/O, cell Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number1_comp/nextD/tmp_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__5/O, cell Number1_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__5. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number2_comp/nextD/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__2/O, cell Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Number2_comp/nextD/tmp_reg[0]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__4/O, cell Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning

Net Number2_comp/nextD/tmp_reg[3]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__6/O, cell Number2_comp/nextD/tmp[3]_i_2__6. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net transformIEEEtoBCD_component/BinaryIntToBCD/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin transformIEEEtoBCD_component/BinaryIntToBCD/done_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell transformIEEEtoBCD_component/BinaryIntToBCD/done_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
